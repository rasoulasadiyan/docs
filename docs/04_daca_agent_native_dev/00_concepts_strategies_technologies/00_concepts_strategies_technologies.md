# Building Agent-Native Cloud Development: Concepts, Strategies, and Technologies

As we venture further into the era of sophisticated artificial intelligence, the focus is increasingly shifting towards building **agentic AI systems** – collections of intelligent, semi-autonomous components that can perceive, reason, act, and interact within complex environments. Developing and scaling these systems reliably in a distributed, cloud-based world presents unique challenges.

To address these challenges and build state-of-the-art AI agents that are not only intelligent but also robust, scalable, and portable, we need a deliberate approach encompassing key architectural **concepts**, strategic decisions about infrastructure and ownership (**strategies**), and the right set of modern, cloud-native **technologies**.

In this chapter, we will bring together the ideas we will explore – from defining our AI agents as "agentic actors" and orchestrating them with Dapr Workflows, to adopting the "Open Core and Managed Edges" strategy for balancing innovation with operational efficiency, enabling a "Cloud Anywhere" deployment model, and leveraging powerful tools like Kubernetes, Helm, Argo CD, and cloud-native observability. This integrated perspective will provide a comprehensive view of how to build and successfully operate your next generation of intelligent agents.

We need all of these concepts, strategies, and technologies to implement the [DACA Design Pattern](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/blob/main/comprehensive_guide_daca.md)
