# MCP Server Development: Empowering AI Agents

Welcome to the MCP Server Development module! This section is dedicated to learning how to build MCP Serversâ€”the crucial components that expose tools, data (resources), and prompt templates to MCP Clients and, by extension, to AI models and agentic systems.

MCP Servers act as the bridge between the abstract reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)/AI Agents and the concrete functionalities of external systems. By adhering to the Model Context Protocol, these servers provide a standardized way for AI agents to discover, understand, and utilize a diverse range of capabilities.

## Core Concepts of MCP Server Development

Throughout this module, we will explore:

1.  **Server Primitives:** How servers define and offer:
    - **Tools:** Executable functions that an AI can request the server to run (e.g., call an API, query a database, perform a calculation).
    - **Resources:** Contextual data that an AI can read and use (e.g., file contents, database records, real-time information).
    - **Prompt Templates:** Pre-defined interaction patterns that guide the AI or user in achieving specific tasks with the server's capabilities.
2.  **Server Lifecycle:** Understanding how a server participates in the MCP session lifecycle, including initialization and capability negotiation with clients.
3.  **SDKs for Server Creation:** Primarily focusing on using the Python `FastMCP` library from the official `modelcontextprotocol-python-sdk` to build servers efficiently.
4.  **Configuration and Metadata:** How servers declare their identity and manage necessary configurations.

## Why MCP Servers are Vital for Agentic Engines (e.g., OpenAI Agents SDK)

Agentic engines, such as the OpenAI Agents SDK, are designed to enable AI models to perform complex tasks by reasoning, planning, and utilizing external tools. MCP Servers enhance these engines significantly:

- **Standardized Tool Integration:** Instead of custom, one-off integrations for every tool or data source, agentic engines can connect to any MCP-compliant server. This drastically simplifies the process of expanding an agent's capabilities.
- **Dynamic Capability Discovery:** Agents can query MCP Servers to discover available tools, resources, and prompts at runtime. This allows for more flexible and adaptive agent behavior.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Developers building agents don't need to write the low-level code for interacting with each external system if an MCP Server already exists for it.
- **Interoperability:** The same MCP Server can potentially serve different agentic engines or AI models, promoting a more open and interoperable ecosystem.
- **Enhanced Contextual Awareness:** By accessing resources through MCP Servers, agents can ground their reasoning and actions in relevant, up-to-date information.

## Learning Path

This module will guide you through the following sub-sections:

- **`01_hello_mcp_server/`**: Getting your first basic MCP server up and running.
- **`02_defining_tools/`**: Exposing executable actions as tools.
- **`03_exposing_resources/`**: Making data available as resources.
- **`04_prompt_templates/`**: Structuring interactions with prompt templates.

## The Role of MCP Servers in the DACA (Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent) Framework

One goal of DACA is to provide a scalable, resilient, and cost-efficient blueprint for agentic AI systems. MCP Servers are a natural fit within the DACA architecture:

- **AI Context Components:** MCP Servers can be implemented as individual microservices or components within DACA's business logic tier. Each server can encapsulate a specific domain capability (e.g., a GitHub MCP Server, a custom reusable MCP Server).
- **Leveraging Dapr:**
  - **Deployment & Scalability:** Dapr can be used to deploy, manage, and scale MCP Servers (especially remote/HTTP-based ones). Dapr sidecars can handle concerns like service discovery and secure communication.
  - **State Management:** For stateful MCP Servers (e.g., those managing resource subscriptions or session-specific data), Dapr's state management building block can provide reliable persistence.
  - **Pub/Sub:** Dapr's pub/sub mechanism can be used by MCP Servers to react to events or to publish notifications about resource changes, which clients might be subscribed to via MCP.
  - **Secrets Management:** Dapr's secrets building block can securely provide sensitive configuration (like API keys) to MCP Servers.
- **Open Core Philosophy:** Custom-built MCP Servers align with DACA's "Open Core" principle, providing foundational, reusable capabilities within the agentic system. These servers can then interact with "Managed Edges" (e.g., calling external managed APIs).
- **Interoperability in Agentia World:** MCP Servers are fundamental to the Agentia World vision, enabling standardized communication and capability sharing between diverse, distributed AI agents. The Streamable HTTP transport, making servers more flexible (including stateless operation), is particularly well-suited for DACA's cloud-native and scalable nature.
