# MCP Protocol Lifecycle and Capability Negotiation

A critical aspect of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is its defined lifecycle for communication sessions between a Client and a Server. This lifecycle ensures that both parties establish a clear understanding of supported features before any substantive interaction occurs. This process is centered around **capability negotiation**. For remote communication, particularly over HTTP, the **Streamable HTTP transport** (part of the 2025-03-26 specification) plays a crucial role in facilitating this lifecycle robustly and efficiently. It supports the establishment and maintenance of MCP sessions, even allowing servers that are operationally stateless to fully participate in the defined lifecycle.

## 1. Connection Initialization

- **Initiation:** The process begins when an MCP Client attempts to establish a connection with an MCP Server.
  - For **Stdio Servers**, this might involve the MCP Host launching the server process and establishing communication over standard input/output pipes.
  - For **HTTP Servers**, this involves the Client making an initial HTTP request to a specific endpoint on the Server.
- **Purpose:** To create a communication channel between the Client and Server.

## 2. Capability Negotiation

This is arguably the most crucial part of the session startup. MCP is designed to be extensible, and not all clients or servers will support all possible features of the protocol. Capability negotiation allows them to agree on a common subset of features for the current session.

- **Client Declares Capabilities:**

  - Upon successful connection, the **Client sends an `initialize` request** (or a similar first message as defined by the specific MCP transport binding, like an initial WebSocket message or HTTP request headers/body) to the Server.
  - This initial message from the Client includes a declaration of the **MCP features it supports** (e.g., "can handle sampling requests," "supports resource subscriptions," "maximum batch size for requests").
  - It also includes metadata about the client itself (e.g., client name, version).

- **Server Responds with its Capabilities:**

  - The **Server processes the Client's `initialize` request** and its declared capabilities.
  - The Server then **responds with its own set of capabilities**, including:
    - The MCP features _it_ supports (e.g., "offers tool `X`," "supports resource `Y`," "can handle batched requests up to size `N`").
    - Metadata about the server (e.g., server name, version, description).
  - Crucially, the Server's response takes into account what the Client declared. For example, a Server won't offer a feature that relies on a client capability if the client didn't declare support for it.

- **Establishing the Negotiated Feature Set:**

  - Once the Client receives the Server's response, both parties have a mutual understanding of the features that can be used for the duration of that session. This forms the "negotiated feature set."
  - For example, if a Server supports "tool invocation" and the Client also declares it supports "tool invocation," then tools can be called. If the Server supports "server-sent notifications for resource subscriptions" but the Client _doesn't_ declare it can handle them, then that feature will not be used in that session.

- **Why is this important?**
  - **Extensibility & Interoperability:** Allows the MCP protocol to evolve with new features without breaking older clients or servers. They simply won't negotiate the use of features they don't understand.
  - **Robustness:** Prevents errors that might occur if a client tries to use a feature a server doesn't support, or vice-versa.
  - **Efficiency:** Clients and servers don't waste resources trying to use unsupported features.

## 3. Active Session: Using Negotiated Features

- Once capabilities are negotiated, the session is active.
- The Client and Server can now exchange messages (Requests, Responses, Notifications) using **only the features agreed upon** during capability negotiation.
- **Examples of interactions based on negotiated capabilities:**
  - If "tool invocation" was agreed upon, the Client can send requests to call tools on the Server.
  - If "resource subscriptions" and "notifications" were agreed upon, the Client can subscribe to resources, and the Server can send notifications.
  - If the Client declared support for "sampling" and the Server also supports initiating it, the Server can send sampling requests to the Client.

## 4. Session Control & Termination

- **Duration:** A session can last for a short period or be long-lived, depending on the application.
- **Termination:**
  - Either the Client or the Server can initiate the termination of a session.
  - This is typically done via a specific message (e.g., a `shutdown` request or notification, or by closing the underlying communication channel like the TCP connection or stdio pipes).
  - Proper termination allows both parties to clean up any resources associated with the session.
- **Error Handling:** If a connection is abruptly lost, both Client and Server should be prepared to handle this gracefully.

Understanding this lifecycle, especially the capability negotiation phase, is fundamental for anyone developing MCP clients or servers, as it dictates how they can reliably and robustly interact.
