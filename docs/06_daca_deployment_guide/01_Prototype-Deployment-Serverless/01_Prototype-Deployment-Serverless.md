## Getting Started

1. Begin with the [Environment Setup](1-Environment-Setup/) section to configure your Azure Container Apps environment
2. Follow the [Containerization](2-Containerization/) guide to prepare your application
3. Set up your [CI/CD Pipeline](3-CI-CD-Pipeline/) for automated deployments
4. Use the [Validation and Testing](4-Validation-and-Testing/) tools to ensure quality
5. Share your prototype and collect feedback using the [Submission and Feedback](5-Submission-and-Feedback/) guides

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Azure CLI installed
- Docker installed locally
- GitHub account
- Basic understanding of container concepts
- Python 3.11+ installed
- UV package manager installed

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management
   - Implement proper access control
   - Enable Dapr security features
   - Regular security audits

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize container images
   - Implement proper scaling
   - Use caching where appropriate
   - Monitor resource usage

3. **Reliability**
   - Implement health checks
   - Use proper error handling
   - Set up monitoring and alerting
   - Regular backups

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - Use appropriate scaling rules
   - Implement resource limits
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Clean up unused resources

## Next Steps
- Progress to [Enterprise Deployment](../02_Enterprise-Deployment-Kubernetes/) when ready for production
- Review the [Planetary Scale Deployment](../03_Planetary-Scale-Deployment/) guide for global distribution
