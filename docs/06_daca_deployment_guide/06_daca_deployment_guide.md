# DACA Deployment Guide: From Prototype to Planetary Scale

## Overview

This comprehensive deployment guide takes you through the journey of deploying containerized AI Agents, from initial prototype to planetary-scale production systems. The guide is structured in three main phases, each building upon the previous one while introducing new tools and concepts.

## Deployment Phases

### 1. Prototype Deployment (Serverless)
- **Objective**: Rapid deployment and validation of AI Agents
- **Key Technologies**: Azure Container Apps, Dapr, GitHub Actions
- **Focus**: Quick iteration, cost-effective, and minimal operational overhead
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks

### 2. Enterprise Deployment (Kubernetes)
- **Objective**: Production-grade deployment with enterprise features
- **Key Technologies**: Civo Kubernetes, Rancher, ArgoCD, Prometheus/Grafana
- **Focus**: Security, scalability, and observability
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks

### 3. Planetary Scale Deployment
- **Objective**: Global distribution and high availability
- **Key Technologies**: Kubernetes Federation, Global Load Balancers, Geo-Replication
- **Focus**: Multi-region deployment, disaster recovery, and global optimization
- **Duration**: 4-8 weeks

## Technology Stack

### Containerization & Orchestration
- Racnher with dockerd for containerization
- Azure Container Apps (Serverless)
- Civo Kubernetes Service
- Rancher for cluster management

### CI/CD & GitOps
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- ArgoCD for GitOps deployments
- Container Registry integration

### Service Mesh & Communication
- Dapr for service-to-service communication
- Sidecar pattern implementation

### Monitoring & Observability
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Loki/EFK for centralized logging
- Distributed tracing

### Security & Compliance
- Azure KeyVault for secrets management
- RBAC and Network Policies
- TLS certificates with CertManager
- Global security policies

### Global Scale Features
- Kubernetes Federation
- Global Load Balancing
- Geo-Replication strategies
- Cross-region autoscaling

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the [Prototype Deployment](01_Prototype-Deployment-Serverless/) phase
2. Progress to [Enterprise Deployment](02_Enterprise-Deployment-Kubernetes/) when ready for production
3. Scale globally using the [Planetary Scale](03_Planetary-Scale-Deployment/) guide

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of containerization (Docker - Rancher Desktop)
- Familiarity with cloud concepts
- GitHub account
- Azure subscription (for prototype phase)
- Civo account (for enterprise and planetary scale phases)
